The app **Measure It!** is the result of a TdR (Treball de Recerca), a project in which students get the opportunity to research in a specific field they like.

The aim of the project is to give everyone a reliable tool to measure and identify the geometries around them at any situation, without any necessity of specific equipment which is not usually carried around, like a meter. To archive that, the solution uses something we all have with us everywhere, our mobile phones. Although there are some solutions which use a more sophisticated way of doing it, we wanted to explore a more mathematical approach. 

This project was developed between 2018 and 2020 by the student Albert Canales Ros, and tutored by Jordi Sorolla, PhD in Mathematics. 

The built app can be found [here](http://www.emathtimes.com/emeasure/), as well as the PDF document, in catalan, explaining the project itself.

Any improvement or suggestion of any kind is far from welcome.

We hope you enjoy it and you find it useful!
